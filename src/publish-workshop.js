const DESCRIPTION = `[h1]SandTogether — Co-op Multiplayer for Sandustry[/h1]
[b]Author: Kamil Padula[/b] — [b]Contributors: dotNine, Knight-HD, DwoaC, Cr0ss0vr, TCentraL, AlyxiaFox, NanYu_sad.[/b]

Play Sandustry together in ONE living world — the same sand, the same factory, the same fluids, streamed live between players. Up to 4 players, over the internet or on a LAN.

[h2]⚠ AFTER SUBSCRIBING — READ THIS (ONE-TIME setup)[/h2]
[b]Installed an early August build and never see updates?[/b] Run the installer ONE more time — a bug in those builds silently broke the auto-updater, so the game kept an old copy of the mod. Every build since fixes itself no matter what the Workshop delivered. Fixed from v0.9.72; after that single re-run, updates are automatic again.

Sandustry has no mod loader yet, so after subscribing you run the installer [b]once[/b]:
[olist]
[*] Let Steam finish downloading the mod.
[*] Open the mod folder: right-click Sandustry → Manage → Browse local files, go up one level, then open steamapps\\workshop\\content\\2764460\\3784750764\\ (or search your PC for "SandTogether").
[*] [b]Windows:[/b] right-click [b]install.bat[/b] → Run.  [b]macOS:[/b] double-click [b]install.command[/b], then launch via SandTogether-Launch.command or Steam.  [b]Linux:[/b] open a terminal [i]in the mod folder[/i] (right-click → Open in terminal) and run [b]bash install-linux.sh[/b] — running it from another folder gives "file not found"; Flatpak Steam or a second library: [b]bash install-linux.sh /path/to/steamapps/common/Sandustry[/b].
[*] Launch the game. A [b]Multiplayer[/b] button appears in the main menu, and a SandTogether panel in the top-right corner.
[/olist]
From then on the mod updates itself at every launch, so both players always match.

[b]Po polsku:[/b] Po zasubskrybowaniu wejdź do folderu moda (Steam → prawy na Sandustry → Zarządzaj → Przeglądaj pliki lokalne → folder wyżej → steamapps\\workshop\\content\\2764460\\3784750764\\) i kliknij prawym [b]install.bat[/b] → Uruchom — tylko RAZ. Potem mod aktualizuje się sam. W menu głównym pojawi się przycisk [b]Multiplayer[/b]. Pełna instrukcja: INSTRUKCJA.md.

[h2]How to play[/h2]
Main menu → [b]Multiplayer[/b] → pick how you want to connect:
[list]
[*] [b]Host (Internet — direct)[/b] — recommended. The mod opens the port on your router by itself (UPnP) and shows your address [b]masked[/b], with show/hide and a copy button that never puts it on screen — safe to stream. Your friend pastes that address into [b]Join by address[/b] (the same button also covers LAN and VPN). This is the fastest route: it does NOT go through Steam relay servers, which throttle bandwidth and add latency.
[*] [b]Host (Steam)[/b] + [b]Invite[/b] — zero setup, invite straight from your Steam friend list.
[*] [b]Host LAN[/b] / [b]Join by address[/b] — same network, or a VPN mesh like Tailscale. One warning: from inside your own network you cannot reach your own public address — most routers refuse it — so when you are both on the same network, use the local 192.168.x.x address.
[*] [b]Join by Lobby ID[/b] — paste an ID from the clipboard.
[/list]
Then press [b]Load last save & PLAY[/b] (or pick a save) — your world is sent to everyone who joins, automatically. Set your nick in the lobby so your friends see who is who.

[h2]Features[/h2]
[list]
[*] One shared live world: sand, fluids, digging, unlocked zones — a single authoritative simulation streamed in real time, with row-delta updates, fog-of-war skipping and rate control that adapts to your connection
[*] Direct internet hosting with automatic router port opening (UPnP), or Steam invites, or LAN — with auto-reconnect on every transport
[*] Every tool works for everyone: shovel, spray, firearms and rockets, vacuum, grabber, flamethrower, cryoblaster, demolisher
[*] One shared factory: build, demolish, move, copy-paste blueprints, pipes, signal wiring and buttons — from both sides
[*] Shared team progression: research and upgrades pool, tech tree, story steps, objectives, critter collection, factory processes — with automatic repair of research broken by older versions
[*] See your teammates: real player models with equipped tools, build ghosts, grabber crosshairs, off-screen arrows, team chat
[*] Rejoin a world and you are back where you left off. Progression — tools, research, upgrades and unlocked buildings — belongs to the host world, so everyone in the session shares it
[*] Steam achievements keep working; the panel warns in red if mod versions or game builds differ
[*] Trilingual UI: English / Polski / 简体中文 (Simplified Chinese by NanYu_sad.), picked from your system language
[*] Windows, macOS and Linux
[/list]

[h2]Performance[/h2]
The world is streamed as changed rows only, compressed, and — between players on the same mod over LAN or a direct connection — as raw binary frames instead of text, which removes a quarter of the bytes and all of the encoding work. Incoming world data is applied in slices across frames, so a big packet never freezes the picture: measured on a full-size world, the worst client frame dropped from 237 ms to about 16 ms while throughput rose past 20 MB/s. The host adapts its send rate to what the link and the slowest client can actually take.

[h2]The SandTogether panel (top-right)[/h2]
[list]
[*] Shows at a glance whether you are OFFLINE, HOSTING or CONNECTED, who is in the session, their ping and mod version
[*] Team chat, world sync stats, [b]Resync[/b] if the mirrored world ever looks out of date, [b]Stop[/b] to leave
[*] Click the panel header (or Ctrl+Shift+H) to shrink it to a tiny dot — handy while streaming or taking screenshots
[/list]

[h2]Trouble?[/h2]
Both players must run the same mod version AND the same game version — the panel says so in red when they differ. If something misbehaves, send me a short description plus your log file: Windows %APPDATA%\\Sandustry\\logs\\main.log, macOS ~/Library/Logs/Sandustry/main.log, Linux ~/.config/Sandustry/logs/main.log. Reports with a log are usually fixed the same day.

[b]Port forwarded and still nothing?[/b] The mod listens on [b]TCP 27777[/b] (TCP, not UDP), and the host Windows Firewall must let [b]Sandustry.exe[/b] through on public networks.

[h2]💛 Thank you — this mod is community-built[/h2]
Code contributors: [b]dotNine[/b] (player models, world auto-transfer, collision sync), [b]Knight-HD[/b] (building placement, grabber rework, teammate ghosts), [b]DwoaC[/b] (the macOS port — installer, launcher and the Steam-callback fix), [b]Cr0ss0vr[/b] (precise client demolish selection, foundation cleanup after demolition, and the report and first patch for progression not reaching the client — the trail that led to the 0.9.132 root cause), [b]TCentraL[/b] (blob-expanding red-tile cleanup — our sharpest tester who then sent code), [b]AlyxiaFox[/b] (congestion control for the world sync) and [b]NanYu_sad.[/b] (the complete Simplified Chinese translation).

    changeNote: 'v0.9.146-beta - Steam invite now tries a direct connection automatically. Host (Steam) still uses the Friends lobby and overlay invite, but also opens TCP 27777 and sends the LAN/public address over P2P after hello. The joining player tries LAN first, then the public IP, with a session token so the open port is not a public lobby. If Direct works, the world stream uses WebSocket (full speed); Steam remains for invites and as fallback when UPnP/CGNAT fail. Also in this drop: contiguous world-ack watermark (no more Swiss-cheese holes on lost packets), resumable save transfer, Steam binary frames, 48 KB Steam batch cap.',
